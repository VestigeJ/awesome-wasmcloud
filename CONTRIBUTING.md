Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

## Quality standards

To be on the list, project repositories should adhere to these quality standards

- Code functions as documented and expected
- Generally useful to the wider community of Go programmers
- Actively maintained
  - Regular, recent commits
  - Or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to
- Stable or progressing toward stable

## Maintainers

We will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any
information is still missing. Please give us a few days to respond to PRs. 

## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes projects fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!
